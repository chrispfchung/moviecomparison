# Comparing 90s, 2000s, and 2010s movies<br>

## Premise<br>
Has the quality of comedy movies / drama movies declined over the last 3 decades?

## Mission
I saw online that many youtube comments said that these early movies were the best and that the quality of movies these days have declined. Iâ€™d like to see if that was true according to the average user ratings from IMDB, a large movie aggregator.
<br>
Most specifically the movies Scary Movie series, Forest Gump and drama movies like Shawshank Redemption where comments have said that the movies were not made like this anymore.
